## Project Overview
- Name: rawdrive
- Type: greenfield
- Project ID: cobolt-rawdrive-f651e4
- Root: C:/Users/admin/Desktop/RawDriveCobolt
- Runtime: Codex IDE and compatible agent runtimes

## Tech Stack
- Detected stack: TBD during planning
- Confirm framework and runtime choices during `/cobolt-plan project`.

## Compliance Requirements
- None captured during init. Record compliance needs during planning if applicable.

## Key Conventions
- `cobolt-state.json` is the pipeline state source of truth.
- `_cobolt-output/` stores reports, audit logs, evidence, and init readiness artifacts.
- `_cobolt-docker/` contains project-scoped Docker Compose assets.
- `.env.cobolt` is for user-provided infrastructure and must stay gitignored.
- `e2e/playwright.config.js` is seeded during init so browser smoke can run at build time.

## Next Steps
- Update `.env.cobolt` if you already have infrastructure.
- Start local services from `_cobolt-docker/` with `docker compose up -d` when needed.
- Run `/cobolt-plan project .` to begin planning.
